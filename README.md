### Realm Relay updated to the DECA era of Realm of the Mad God
##I updated realm relay to the current build X15.0.0 as of June 2017.

### What's new?
`Packets have been updated`
`All new packets have been added`
`Minor bug fixes, as well as some performance enhancements (f*ck outta here 100% thread usage)`
`Packet structures have been updated`

### What still needs to be done?
`New packets have been added, but the app doesn't parse them yet.`
`The XML files containing tiles, objects, and items still need to be updated to current builds. (Easy fix, just need to parse the new xml data tags from pets)`

### I want to make a new addition to realm relay, what would be cool to add?
`Make it so that you can type /reload in game so that all scripts get refreshed. Currently the refresh when you switch maps but having them refresh instantly would be amazing.`
`Better non-blocking IO. You can't really sit in a loop in a script without lagging out. It might be the javascript engines fault.`
